# NYC_Taxi
The expansion of alternative service, such as Uber, has affected the profit of the taxi industry. This project aims to perform some insightful analysis and predictions to help taxi drivers increase their incomes. 

## Dataset

The data set covers trips taken in various different types of licensed taxi and limousine services in the New York City area. The data is freely available to download from www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/ about/trip_record_data.shtml.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, to explore the relationship between tip_amount and other attributes, we found that the amount of tip may correlated with fares, distance, duration and different location. Regarding the impact of public holiday on tip amount, we can not confirm it confidently since there is only one holiday in July.

There are some recommendations based on the research above. Firstly, Manhattan is a popular area where has large demand of taxis. If the taxi is available, the drivers can wait for orders near some popular areas in Manhattan, which may produce a continuation of daily orders. However, the average tip amount is not very high in Manhattan. By contrast, Queens is another area which advised to pick up passengers if the drivers want to earn more tip. Also, the research shows that reaching the destination quickly can increase the probability to get more tips. 

The model can be used to predict the level of tip, which allows drivers to consider the way to increase the amount of tip. Moreover, the taxi company also can use the model to detect the anomaly of data recording since the cash tip will not be recorded automatically and the tip is taxable.
